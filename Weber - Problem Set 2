cd ~                    --> change directory to home directory
mkdir ./problem_set_1   --> make a new directory in the home directory called "problem_set_1"
touch submission.txt    --> make a new file called "submission.txt" in home directory 
cd ..                   --> relative path, changes the directory to 1 layer above which is the Users directory
pwd                     --> prints working directory
                            prints "/Users/hannahweber" which is the home directory
                            
#2: help from Jack, helped Taylor
cd /                    --> changes directory to root directory
cp ~/config.txt .       --> copies file from home directory called "config.txt" to the current directory which is the root
mkdir ./preferences     --> creates a new directory in the root called "preferences"
cd preferences          --> changes the working directory to preferences
cp ~/preferences/prefs.txt .  --> copies file from home preferences directory called "prefs.txt" to therpreferences directory
head -n 100 config.txt   --> look at the start and the end of the "prefs.txt" document 
tail -n 100 config.txt

#3:
Root - It is important to have a shortcut for root because it is the highest directory and all of the other files on the computer stem from this one and so there needs to be easy access to it.
Home - There needs to be a shortcut for home because it is an important directory where most of the users files are stored on their computer. 
Parent - The parent directory is the one stemming directly above the current directory. It is important to have a parent shortcut because when diving into files in a directory it is necessary to have an easy-to-use go back option that will save the user from going through the troubles of using the change directory command again.

#4: help from Jacob
cd /usrs/INFO 3401/                             --> change the directory to "INFO 3401" which is stored under the parent directory "usrs"
cd /usrs/INFO 3401/ ../homework/                --> will go back to the "usrs" folder and into the directory titled "homework"
cd /usrs/INFO 3401/ ../homework/ ./problem1     --> in the "homework" directory it will go to the directory titled "problem1"
pwd                                             --> it will print the working directory which is /usrs/homework/problem1
